    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>A lot of times, we write journal entries about things that stood out to us during our day. Unfortunately, reflecting back on<br> them after a while is difficult, because it requires us to reread what we wrote a while back. With this as my motive, I have<br> created Euva, a journal app that allows users to reflect on their emotional behavior over a period of time.</p>
<h2>What it does<br>
    100% Confidential ― Write In Private</h2>
<p>Your journals, your privacy. Euva requires users to login with a Google Account to strengthen account protection. Journals<br> are also saved in an encrypted format, so not only will getting hands on them be a problem, but so will comprehending<br> them.</p>

<h2>Not Just A Text Editor ― It's A Block Editor</h2>
<p>While typing in a plain text editor can be boring, Euva offers an intuitive block editor. Block editors allow users to create and<br> organize sections within an entry. Additionally, they allow users to move, edit, and delete blocks easily.</p>

<h2>Sentimental Analysis Charts</h2>
<p>Upon saving a journal, Euva uses a sentimental artificial intelligence model to determine the overall sentiment of your day<br>. Afterwards, Euva displays its predictions on an interactive doughnut chart.</p>

<h2>Sentimental Scores Tracked Over Time</h2>
<p>Over time, Euva saves sentimental progress from a user and displays it on an interactive graph allowing the user to reflect<br> on their emotional progress over a period of time. Euva allows users to analyze graphs with a line graph and bar chart.</p>

<h2>How i built it</h2>
<p>I used Python3 as my backend language and connected it to my frontend using Flask. To build my user interface, I used<br> HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jinja. I used Bootstrap.css to quickly make user friendly components. To create interactive<br> graphs such as the line graph, bar chart, and doughnut chart, I used the Chartjs Javascript framework. For building a block<br> editor, I use the Editorjs Javascript framework and I styled it using my own CSS. I used Google's service account API to<br> allow users to login with a one click sign in with Google. In addition, logging in with Google strengthens account<br> protection. I saved user information and journal entries in an encrypted format into a MYSQL database. Finally, to perform<br> sentimental analysis upon journal entries, I used a transformers based neural network.</p>

<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>
<p>I am not a frontend expert, so while creating this project I ran into many issues. Many of these issues involved styling my<br> website with CSS. There were times when I was frustrated that components didn't look<br> the way I imagined them to look like. Other times, components didn't align properly and they were randomly positioned. Apart from CSS, I also had some<br> troubles with Javascript. I wanted to use my Flask server as a REST API for my Javascript to be able to access, but there<br> was always some error that came upon trying to do so. After a long time, I found a stackoverflow solution that told my to<br> turn of CORS on my Flask app and I was able to use my Flask app as a REST API and my Javascript was able to access it.</p>

<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>
<p>While making this project, there are many things I believe I have accomplished. For starters, I was able to create a full stack<br> application while using many frameworks and languages. I am also proud of the UI I built for this application and the color<br> combination I chose. I am also proud of how I was able to use Flask and its features. In addition, I believe that while<br> building this project, I gained lots of experience with handling data with MYSQL.</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>Building this project taught me lots of things. I learned a lot about frontend development and CSS. In addition, I learned<br> how to use Chartjs and Editorjs to build interactive components. This app was also the first time I used the Google service<br> account API to validate users, so learning how to do that was also fun. I also learned more about Flask and neural networks<br> in this project. This project was the first time I touched the concept of neural networks, so doing so taught me a lot about<br> them. Finally, I improved my Python and MYSQL skills upon building this project.</p>

<h2>What's next for Euva</h2>
<p>Eventually, I hope to host Euva live on the internet for people to use. I really hope you enjoyed my project and please let me<br> know what you thought of it in the comments below.</p>
